	<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>Moonakes have a long history in China that dates back many years. They have been around for almost 3,000 years, but their exact origin is unsure. There are many stories and legends regarding mooncakes, and people aren't really sure what is true or not. One theory states that the original mooncake was called Taishi and dates back to the Zhou and Shang Dynasties. There is also a legend that says during the Tang Dynasty, Moo cakes became linked to the Mid-Autumn festival. The emperor’s concubine named the cakes mooncakes and they symbolize the full moon that is present during the harvest. The moon is also very important in the fall festival, so the cakes share that prominence. People believed that eating the cakes during the Mid-Autumn festival would bring good luck and reunion of far away family members. Even to this day, they still are valued for the tradition regarding love and unity that they bring to the festival.

	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Mooncakes are a beautiful pastry that often have fillings of red bean or lotus seed paste. They also often have salted egg yolk in the middle or other additional ingredients. They usually have a round or wavy circle shape that is stamped or carved with an intricate design. The thin crust is baked to a golden brown and is often stuffed full with a delicious filling. This dessert is fairly small, and can be enjoyed as a quick sweet. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, this dessert has a lot of cultural significance and is often associated with unity and luck. People often eat it together in celebration and it is also connected to moon watching. Overall, this dessert is both wonderful to eat and has a rich connection with Chinese culture that spans back many centuries.
