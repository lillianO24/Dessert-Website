	<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>While the exact origin is not confirmed, people speculate that dango (団子) has been around in Japan since the Jomon era. It was originally made by mixing ground nuts, a flower like powder, and hot rice, and it has since evolved. During the Muromachi period, people began to put the dango on skewers, and this has continued to the present day. Earlier in its history, it was also used as an offering to gods. Just like many other desserts, it started out very simple, and people progressively started to add more ingredients. As time passed, dango gained even more popularity, and it became common at festivals such as the Hanami (cherry blossom/flower viewing) festival.

	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Dango is usually made using rice flour and water to make a dough that is rolled into small balls and placed on a skewer. It has a texture similar to mochi and is often very chewy! There are many types of dango, and people sometimes add fillings as well. Mitsarashi (みたらし団子) dango is one of the most popular types, and is made of plain dango covered in a sweet soy sauce glaze. Hanami (花見だんご) dango is commonly made for the Hanami festival but is also a popular choice at any time. It is characterized by its unique colors of pink, white, and green. There are also many other types and flavors of dango to satisfy your sweet tooth!
