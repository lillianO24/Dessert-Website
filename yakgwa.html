	<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>Yakgwa (약과) is a delicious, cookie-like dessert that originated in Korea during the era of the three kindoms (around 57 B.C to A.D. 668). The first syllable, yak (약), means medicine, and the second syllable, gwa (과), means cookie or confection. When put together, they create "medicinal confection." This is because of the generous amounts of honey that are used to make yakgwa, and Koreans thought of honey as a medicinal ingredient. It was popular during the Goryeo era, where it was used for rituals, greetings, and marriage. It was used instead of meat during rituals and was shaped into different fruits when the actual fruit could not be found. It was so popular that there was a lack of the ingrediens needed to make it.</p></center>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Also known as gwajul (과줄), is a dessert that falls under the umbrella of yumil-gwa desserts. This means that it is a deep fried, wheat based confection. As previously mentioned, yakgwa was originally shaped into fruit or other figures, but it is currently more common to see it in a circular shape. This sweet was originally offered during ancestral rites and eaten on special holidays such as chuseok, the harvest fesitval, or marriages. Yakgwa typically tastes like very sweet honey, due to the fact that it is made with lots of honey as well as flour and oil. It has a pleasent, chewy texture and is perfect for any special occasions or whenever you want a treat!   </p>
