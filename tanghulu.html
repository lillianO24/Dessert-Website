	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>As previously mentioned, tanghulu is a type of candied fruit that is extremely easy to make. It started out with hawthorn berries, but people often use grapes, strawberries, and tangerines as well. Once the fruit is placed on a skewer, it is dipped in a boiling mixture of sugar and water. Once the fruit is coated, it is placed in ice water where it hardens immediately. The process is very simple, but if the sugar is at the wrong temperature when the fruit is dipped, the result might be very sticky! People often aim for a glass-like texture that results in the satisfying crunch when bitten into. </p>
