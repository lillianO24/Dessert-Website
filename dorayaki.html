<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>Dorayaki (どら焼き) also known as mikasa (三笠), originated in Japan around the early 1900s. Originally, dorayaki was one layer, but its current shape was invented around 1914. The first syllable, dora, means gong, which alludes to the similar shape that they share. The second syllable, yaki, means “cooked on dry heat.” There is a legend that accompanies this sweet treat, and it basically tells of a samurai who left his gong (dora) at a farmer’s house. The farmer then used the gong to make dorayaki! This event probably never happened, but it’s a fun story to go with the delicious snack.

	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Dorayaki is a popular snack made primarily with castella and red bean paste. Most dorayaki are shaped as a circle and resemble a small sandwich of two castella slices with red bean/azuki paste in the middle. You can often find street vendors or bakeries that sell dorayaki in Japan, and it is also popular in the United States as well. Continually, despite the fact that red bean is the most traditional filling, dorayaki can also be stuffed with things such as matcha, ice cream, or custard. It’s a quick and delicious snack and I would absolutely recommend it!
