<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>Dalgona (달고나), a popular Korean street food, originated around the 1960s in Korea. It was particularly popular in the 1970s and 1980s and would be sold outside schools to appeal to children. This sweet treat was a nice snack and also provided kids with a game to play. It often has a shape in the middle, and if you are able to trim around the shape successfully, you get an extra one for free! Aditionally, dalgona was and still is very cheap and offered a fun time, so children really loved it! This dessert really gained popularity amongst many people during the release of the Netflix show "Squid Games." Dalgona is featured heavily in one of the episodes, and as a result, its popularity rose immensly. Now, dalgona can also be found in coffee form, ice cream, or confections and pasteries! If you're ever in Korea, trying dalgona coudld be a fun and immersive experience! </p></center>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Dalgona is a candy that is made from melted sugar and baking soda. The baking soda that is mixed with the melted sugar causes a reaction that makes the sugar puff up and become crunchy when hardened. While the mixture is still a liquid, it is pressed flat and engraved with a fun image such as an umbrella, heart, or star. These are the shapes that customers will try to break out of the center. Dalgona has a crunchy consistency, much like toffee and tastes very sweet! If you ever have a chance to try this delicious candy, good luck winning the game!</p>
