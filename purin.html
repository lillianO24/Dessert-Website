	<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>Purin (プリン), although it is a popular Japanese dessert, did not actually originate in Japan. Purin can be seen as a variation of European pudding. Pudding was around in Europe for many years and it is said that the British introduced the Japanese to custard pudding in the early Meiji period. The name "purin," comes from the word pudding and was mentioned in a document around 1872. At first, it showed up in European-style hotels and was slowly integrated into yoshoku (Western food in a Japanese syle) restaurants. It really became popular in the 1960s, and it has continued to be an adored dessert in Japan. It also might be familiar from a popular Sanrio character based off of the dessert: Pom Pom Purin. Throughout its history, this dessert has become one of the most loved sweets in Japan that can be found in most bakeries!  </p></center>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Purin is most often made with sugar, milk, and eggs, and it is covered in a layer of caramel sauce. It is very similar to crème caramel or flan and is also compared to crème brûlée. The custard is served cold, it is firm enough to stand on its own, but it also has a jello-like reaction when you shake it. It has a very smooth, silky texture and will melt in your mouth! While this does resemble many other desserts, this particular custard is unique to Japan, and its distinct shape, a dome like curve with a flat top, is recognizable anywhere. The slightly bitter caramel sauce also perfecty melds with the sweet custard for a deliious dessert to enjoy while sitting peacefully in a quaint cafe.</p>
