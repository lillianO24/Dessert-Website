<center><h2>Origins</h2></center>
	<center><p>Egg tarts, while they are a popular Chinese dessert, have origins in Europe. Also known as dan tat, this custard tart is originally from Great Britain. It made a long journey from Europe to the city of Canton, now called Guangzhou. It arrived in China around 1920, and since then, it has continued to grow and develop throughout time. Some of the oldest custard tart recipes date back to around 1450 in England. Guangzhou’s ports were mostly open to European trade and led to the development of Cantonese cuisine. This type of egg tart has stayed mostly the same since its arrival in China, but it still remains a very popular dessert. There are also other variations that arrived from Portugal, but either way, egg tart is a delicious, sweet dessert that you should definitely try!

	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Egg tarts are made primarily with flour, butter, sugar, egg, custard, and milk. These tarts have a light and crispy crust, and they have a delicious, creamy egg filling. This dessert is often served in dim sum restaurants and can also be found in cafes. The Hong Kong variation of tarts are typically smaller and are often served in groups of two or three. They were popularized amongst the working class in Hong Kong. This contrasts the original Guangzhou tarts which were larger. They can also be filled with chocolate, green tea, or bird's nest. Macau is another variation that is based off of a Portuguese tart. People believe this tart originated from Portuguese monks, and it has a slightly different appearance. The tart is slightly larger and is also slightly caramelized on top. No matter what type you choose, these egg tarts are sure to be delicious!
